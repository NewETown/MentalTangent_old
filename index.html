      <h4>About Us</h4>
      <p>Mental Tangent is a startup founded in May 2013 by Everett Carney and Bryant Smick. We created Mental Tangent as a platform for us to bring everything from web services to mobile apps to people around the world.</p>
      <p>Our primary market is Generation Y. We feel strongly connected to our peers through technology; our focus is improving that connection with useful apps and top tier web services.</p>

      <h4>What exactly do we do?</h4>
 
      <p>We have two large projects in the works at the moment but they're a little too new to divulge any details on. I can promise that they'll be useful, unique, and both provide new (awesome) ways to interact with your peers.</p>
 
      <p>Mental Tangent also provides consulting services for people looking to start anything from a personal project to a new company. We have a wide range of skills including technical, legal, business, and marketing that our clients can tap into to make sure they accomplish their goals.</p>

        <p>Everett studied Computer Science at Washington State University before leaving school early to pursue a career in the video game industry. He spent the next two years at ArenaNet working on Guild Wars 2 as a Software Development Engineer in Test. Everett left ArenaNet to try out a Program Manager position with Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business; for the next seven months he managed two groups of DevOps engineers focused on monitoring and building automation to keep Xbox Live (and other "Live" services) afloat. Ultimately he left Microsoft in June 2013 to pursue Mental Tangent and his personal goals.</p>
